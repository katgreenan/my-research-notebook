In addition to the Adler Number, or record number, Outwit also exports the source url of the information being collected, as well the collection time of the data. While the benefit of the source url is quite simple - you need to be able to trace that information back down, the collection time is somewhat curious. In this particular instance, it does not appear to be very useful, as all my data was collected at the same time. However, I can definitely see this being incredibly useful for tracking, say for example, a Wikipedia entry or another resource that is prone to undergo many changes. Having a collection time would allow one to maintain all data in one spreadsheet, yet be able to differentiate between separate scraping sessions and have some interesting possibilities in terms of visualizing or comparing the data. 

I think so far, this is the exercise that has 'confused' me the most. While it was relatively simple to do (though I had to search how to view source when using Safari); it's the first thing I've done in the course that I don't really understand the coding mechanics of what I was looking at. This is to be expected, considering I have such a limited knowledge of anything beyond HTML - but it makes me wary of things to come.
