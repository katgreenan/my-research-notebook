    <h1>This is Volkorn!</h1>
    <p>This is Open Sans. These two fonts work together because Volkorn is a serif and Open Sans is a sans-serif. This means that they're different enough to stand out from each other! I chose my body font (Open Sans) first, and then decided on a headerfont from there. I wanted something that was readable at a somewhat small size for versatility. But also wanted something that 'felt' me. If I am to use this font in an assessment of who <i>I</i> am, I want to see myself in those words.</p>

    <h1>Uhhh, What's Happening Here?!</h1>
    <p>You may notice that I've copied this page again in order to switch the positions of each font. Mainly I'm doing this as a comparison for myself. As much as I adore Open Sans for feeling <i>me</i>, being a sans serrif, it doesn't take to italics very well. That's kind of a dealbreaker for me. See, I use emphasis <b>a lot</b> throughout my writing. It's not you, Open Sans; it's me.</p>
