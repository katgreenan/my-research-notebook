    <h1>This is Volkorn!</h1>
    <p>This is Open Sans. These two fonts work together because Volkorn is a serif and Open Sans is a sans-serif. This means that they're different enough to stand out from each other! I chose my body font (Open Sans) first, and then decided on a headerfont from there. I wanted something that was readable at a somewhat small size for versatility. But also wanted something that 'felt' me. If I am to use this font in an assessment of who <i>I</i> am, I want to see myself in those words.</p>
    <p>What's the opposite of sunshine and happiness? Why death and decay, of course. Again, background colours not playing nice. It's funny, because it worked when I had both sets of original text on each page (so the entire code repeated) but not since I put one part on each page. (which was because for some reason they both switched to the same font settings, which was kind of against the point) Anyways, grey isn't a terrible choice in itself, but paired with red, it seems violent, moody, and downcast. Not quite the impression I'm trying to give.</p>
