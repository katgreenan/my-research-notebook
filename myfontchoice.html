    <h1>Uhhh, What's Happening Here?!</h1>
    <p>You may notice that this is different from the "counter-myfontchoice" file. I've switched the positions of each font. Mainly I'm doing this as a comparison for myself. As much as I adore Open Sans for feeling <i>me</i>, being a sans serrif, it doesn't take to italics very well. That's kind of a dealbreaker for me. See, I use emphasis <b>a lot</b> throughout my writing. It's not you, Open Sans; it's me.</p>
