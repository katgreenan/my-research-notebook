    <h1>Uhhh, What's Happening Here?!</h1>
    <p>You may notice that this is different from the "counter-myfontchoice" file. I've switched the positions of each font. Mainly I'm doing this as a comparison for myself. As much as I adore Open Sans for feeling <i>me</i>, being a sans serrif, it doesn't take to italics very well. That's kind of a dealbreaker for me. See, I use emphasis <b>a lot</b> throughout my writing. It's not you, Open Sans; it's me.</p>
    <p>So what are these colours doing right now? Unfortunately I couldn't get the background colour to work for me, which means I had to change my ideal colour for the body, yellow (intellectual, joy, happy, upbeat) to orange (warm, stimulating, enthusiastic). It definitely still works, just not exactly what I wanted. However, I had the choice of switching, or having damn near unreadable yellow text on a white background. It does kind of ruin the reason I chose blue for the header though. I chose it because together with yellow, it makes people think of sunny days and soda pop.</p>
