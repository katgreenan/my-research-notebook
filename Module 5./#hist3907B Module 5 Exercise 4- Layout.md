Out of the two options for poster designed by Ugo Sangiorgi, I chose the blue poster specifically because I thought that the circular element would complement the tone of the assessment well -insert circle of life clip-

Little did I know that I had chosen... *poorly*

Unfortunately, all the minute details that Sangiorgi added to make his poster really stand out at his conference, made it incredibly difficult to repurpose the template for another project (at least with my limited Inkscape skills)

Regardless of whether I was actually able to repurpose the template, it really did have potential to work wonderfully in representing my assessment piece. It all feeds into itself, lending a real sense of unity to the project.
