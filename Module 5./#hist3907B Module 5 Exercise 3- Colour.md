I don't think I've ever put so much consideration into what colour to make things, ever. 

I usually just think: "what looks good?"

Now I'm sitting here pondering whether my colour choices accurately convey the message I'm trying to get across and whether those who perceive colour differently will be able to read my work. 

Stressful, I tell you. 

Main take away seems to be use **contrasting** colours, not *complementary* colours. Seems reasonable. 

Explanations for colour choices have been given in the HTML pages in my repo.
