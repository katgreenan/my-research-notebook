##Font Guide
###Adapted from [Using Fonts with Purpose](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/705/04/)

- Serif fonts have 'feet'
	- Times New Roman
- Sans-Serif font do not have 'feet'
	- Arial
- Sans-Serif fonts are generally easier to read in electronic materials
- Never combine two different fonts of the same family
- Sans-serifs are typically used for titles or heading
- Limit use of decorative fonts, unique features make them harder to read for extended periods
	- Use for emphasis
- Fonts can convey more 'human-like' traits as well
	- Use a font that suits your message, would you use a hyper-modern font on your poster about ancient Greece?
- Keep readability in mind, some fonts look very different depending on the size
- Sans-serifs often don't have a great italicized version (just slanted)

###[Type Connection](http://www.typeconnection.com)

I found that I generally prefer to match opposing fonts (so one serif, and another sans-serif). I actually really enjoyed this resource, as it was a bit of a silly concept, (font dating) but I feel like I learned a lot about how to better pair fonts and determine whether they convey the message I want them to. 

###My Font Choice

I have this thing where I am all about sans-serifs. (And I love that I can now actually explain what I'm talking about as opposed to just saying I like Helvetica) I really, really like them. They look so clean and crisp. In my head, everything is Helvetica. 

In practice, however, things don't quite work out. Maybe it's me being deeply committed to Times New Roman when doing academic writing, but when a serif and a sans serif are contrasted against each other - especially on a blank page like in this exercise - a page of sans serif seems immature to me. 

That, and I use italics a lot when typing to add emphasis and make it seem more *me*. As sad as it is to admit, most sans serifs look stupid italicized. So I sucked it up, made some choices, and accepted that I could keep my beloved Open Sans for my numerous headings.
