I explored both the Epigraphic and CWGC databases. I do not know any latin and found the Epigraphic database confusing to use. I enjoyed the CWGC database, as it ties in more with my project, to a degree. I searched both my last name and my mother's maiden name in the CWGC. My mother's name had significantly more hits, as it is a more common name, from my understanding. 

Search results for surname: Willis; Served with United Kingdom Forces; Served with: Canadian Forces - http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead.aspx?cpage=1

Search results for surname: Greenan - http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead.aspx?cpage=1

I am storing the data in my Github folder on my machine, as they do not transfer well to Github.
