Ran into issues from the get-go, as I'm on a Mac. I used the guide provided and set Gephi to run an older version of Java.

I set to work on my visualization, and to be honest, until I hit refresh (the last step) I was really quite certain I had done something terribly wrong. 

Ultimately, it seems as though I did do this correctly - regardless of whether I really know how to interpret this data.

I enjoyed this process, it was a really lovely break from the heavy, code-based stuff we've been doing previously.
