- Primary Data: tweets containing the word [holocaust](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=holocaust&src=typd) 

- Collection method: Utilize [Twarc](https://github.com/edsu/twarc) to create a library of tweets making references to 'Holocaust' 

- Repository structure: Currently not in existence, will be creating a new repositiory on GitHub in order keep track of research on the matter.   

- Secondary Readings: [Open Notebook](https://github.com/katgreenan/my-research-notebook) Nothing currently here concerning the project, but I will be uploading notes, bibliographical data, and useful tools for the assignment. 
  
- Initial thoughts on what you might find/explore/puzzle over

I think I may find that I have bitten off more than I can chew by choosing such a broad topic to examine. My current plan is to do some investigating into common trends that appear in discussions on the holocaust and further filter my library by terms associated with each (for example: holocaust deniers, academic comments, the holocaust in popular culture, and further filtering for Holocaust Memorial Day - just a few thoughts for now). I definitely think that creating word clouds with Twarc will be infinitely useful in my coming up with a way to display the data I am collecting.  

I am continuing to explore options as to how I will display this information, and this module (module 4) will be infinitely useful for me in determining this.
